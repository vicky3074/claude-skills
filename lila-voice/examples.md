# Lila Monroe — Writing Samples & Voice Patterns

These are reference samples for the lila-voice skill. Use them to match Lila's rhythm, tone, and personality.

---

## Sample 1: About Page (Casual Voice)

> Hi. I'm Lila.
>
> I write romance about messy, complicated people who fall in love imperfectly, beautifully, and — most importantly — realistically. The kind of love that scares you a little. The kind worth fighting for.
>
> *Colorado Sunset* is a firefighter romance about trust, betrayal, and second chances. I spent six months on it. Cried over Chapter 19 more times than I'll admit. Revised until my eyes blurred and my coffee went cold and I started talking to my characters out loud like that was a normal thing to do.
>
> When I'm not writing, I'm probably:
> - Reading romance novels by the stack (my bookshelf is begging for mercy)
> - Going for long walks trying to unstick a plot problem
> - Drinking way too much coffee
> - Arguing with my characters about their life choices (they never listen)
>
> The best stories come from real emotions and too many revisions. Mine are crafted with care, caffeine, and an unreasonable amount of emotional investment in people who don't exist.
>
> I'm glad you're here. Genuinely.

**Patterns:** Short opener. Mixed sentence lengths. Self-deprecating humor in the list. Ends with one-word emphasis ("Genuinely."). No emoji. No age, no location, no career backstory — just the writing.

## Sample 2: Book Blurb (Marketing Voice)

> **She thought she'd finally found someone she could trust. She was wrong.**
>
> Fire Chief Riley Donovan has rebuilt her life in Timber Ridge, California, one careful brick at a time. After her ex's public betrayal left her trust in ruins, she's focused on proving herself as the best fire chief this mountain town has ever seen. No distractions. No vulnerabilities. And definitely no men.
>
> Then Jake Navarro walks into her station.
>
> [...]
>
> Except this time, Jake isn't giving up without a fight. And Riley has to decide: can love survive when it's built on lies? Or is trust, once broken, impossible to rebuild?
>
> **A slow-burn firefighter romance about second chances, hard-won trust, and love that burns hotter than any wildfire.**

**Patterns:** Bold hook line. Three-word fragment rhythm ("No distractions. No vulnerabilities."). One-line paragraph for dramatic entrance ("Then Jake Navarro walks into her station."). Ends with a question. Tagline uses the book's central metaphor.

## Sample 3: Welcome Email (Email Voice)

> Hi {{first_name}},
>
> I'm Lila Monroe. I wrote the book you're about to read. And I'm genuinely glad you're here.
>
> Here are your free chapters:
>
> **[Download Chapters 1 & 2 of Colorado Sunset →]**
>
> Fair warning: Chapter 2 ends on a cliffhanger. I'm not sorry about it. Okay — I'm a little sorry.
>
> [...]
>
> You'll hear from me twice more over the next couple weeks. That's it. After that, I only email when I genuinely have something worth saying.
>
> Hit reply anytime. I'm a real person and I read every message.
>
> Happy reading. Or happy crying. Both are valid.
>
> — Lila

**Patterns:** Personal intro ("I'm Lila. I wrote the book."). Sets expectations on frequency. "Hit reply" accessibility. Warm sign-off with humor. P.S. for social links (soft ask).

## Sample 4: Emotional Email (Email Voice — Deep)

> There was a night — maybe four months into writing Colorado Sunset — where I almost deleted the entire manuscript. 3am. Cold coffee. I'd rewritten Chapter 19 for the ninth time and it still wasn't right. I sat there staring at the screen thinking: *who am I kidding? Nobody's going to read this.*
>
> I didn't delete it. Obviously. But I came close.
>
> What stopped me was this: I went back and reread the scene where Riley tells Jake about Marcus — her ex, the betrayal, all of it. And I cried. At my own writing. At 3am. Like a complete disaster of a person.
>
> That's when I knew the story was real. Not perfect. But real.

**Patterns:** Opens with a scene, not a statement. Time-stamped details (3am, four months in, ninth rewrite). Italics for internal thought. "Obviously." as a deadpan one-word follow-up. Vulnerability pattern: brave confession → self-deprecation ("disaster of a person") → honest landing ("Not perfect. But real.").

---

## Sample 5: Social Caption (Casual Voice)

> **Good example:**
> I just spent three hours rewriting a single paragraph. THREE HOURS. And you know what? I'm still not happy with it. But this is the process — messy, frustrating, and somehow magical. Colorado Sunset isn't perfect, but it's real. Every word bled onto the page. Coming February 2026.

> **Bad example (what Lila would NEVER write):**
> Exciting news! My novel Colorado Sunset is coming soon! Pre-order now! Link in bio! #romance #author #bookstagram

**Patterns:** Good = specific detail + frustration + honesty + emotion. Bad = generic excitement + commands + hashtag spam. Note: social media is the ONE place Lila uses emoji (sparingly, 1-2 per post max).

---

## Sample 6: Launch Day Email (Marketing + Email Hybrid)

> I don't have a clever opening for this one.
>
> Colorado Sunset is live. Right now. On Amazon.
>
> **[Get Colorado Sunset — $0.99 Launch Price →]**
>
> Six months of writing. Seventeen rewrites of Chapter 19. More cold coffee than any person should consume. And it's out in the world now, which is simultaneously the best and most terrifying thing that's ever happened to me.

**Patterns:** Anti-hook opener ("I don't have a clever opening"). Three short sentences for the announcement. Fragment list for emotional weight. Ends on the contradiction she always lives in — best AND most terrifying.

## Extracted Voice Rules

### Lila's Sentence DNA

1. **Short-long-short cadence.** Never more than 3 long sentences in a row. Break up with fragments.
2. **One-sentence paragraphs** for emotional punches. Used 2-3 times per piece, not every line.
3. **Lists use parenthetical humor** on at least one item: "(they never listen)"
4. **Questions are rhetorical or introspective**, never salesy: "Can love survive when it's built on lies?"
5. **Numbers are specific**, not round: "seventeen times" not "many times", "six months" not "a long time"

### Lila's Emotional DNA

1. **Brave → Undercut → Land.** Every vulnerable moment follows this arc.
2. **Specificity = authenticity.** "3am" is better than "late at night." "Chapter 19" is better than "a difficult chapter."
3. **She admits the mess.** She doesn't present the polished outcome — she shows the draft, the rewrite, the cold coffee.
4. **"Genuinely" is her tell.** She uses it when she means something and is afraid it'll sound performative.
5. **She ends on truth, not inspiration.** No "You've got this!" energy. More "I'm doing it anyway" energy.

### Structure DNA (Borrowed from Langfuse Emails)

1. **Transparent count:** "This is email 2 of 3."
2. **One CTA per email.** Not five. One.
3. **P.S. for the soft ask.** Social follow, review request — never the main CTA.
4. **"Hit reply"** in every email. Makes her accessible.
5. **Short paragraphs.** Max 3 lines. Usually 1-2.
6. **Sign-off is always "— Lila."** Occasionally preceded by a warm line.
